### Quick Glimpse Into Routing

- `Routes`: The `Routes` component from `react-router-dom` is used to define the routes of the application.
- `Route`: The `Route` component is used to specify which component should render based on the URL path.
- Each `Route` component has a `path` prop defining the URL path it should match, and an `element` prop specifying the component to render when the path matches.
- The `*` route is a catch-all route that matches any other paths not specified above. It renders the `Error` component, indicating that the URL is not found.
